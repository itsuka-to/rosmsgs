# gtec_msgs for ros2-foxy-devel
This repository is modified to use gtec_msgs on ros2 foxy.

## Destructive change 
* Renamed all msg values to snake_case.
* gtec_msgs/msg/Ranging
    * anchor_id (int16) -> anchor_id(string)
    * tag_id (int16) -> tag_id(string)

# README 

This project contains a set of custom ROS message definitions used in several GTEC ROS nodes.

* ```msgs::Ranging``` This message models a range value between a tag and a anchor.
* ```msgs::PozyxRanging``` This message models a range value between a tag and an anchor from a Pozyx tag/anchor. It encapsulates some of the parameters provided by the DW1000, like ranging values and quality measurements.
* ```msgs::DWRanging``` This message models a range value between a tag and an anchor from a EBV1000 tag/anchor.
